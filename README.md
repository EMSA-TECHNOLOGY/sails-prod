sails-prod (Ported from Sails.js 0.12.3) is a web framework that makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.

WHY WE DO THIS WHILE SAILS IS STILL THERE?

* Sails 1.x is a big breaking change and we have no time to migrate & Sails 0.12.x is no more continued/maintained.
* Our final purpose is to continue to develop/maintain this version for production based.
* All libraries shall be verified/re-selected to be conformed with real production.
* More tests shall be added.

## Installation &nbsp;
**With [node](http://nodejs.org) [installed](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation/new-to-nodejs):**
```sh
# Get the latest stable release of Sails
$ npm install sails-prod -g
```

## Your First sails-prod Project

**Create a new app:**
```sh
# Create the app
$ sails-prod new testProject
```

**Start your app:**
```sh
# cd into the new folder
$ cd testProject

# fire up the server
$ sails-prod lift
```

**Generate a REST API:**

## Compatibility

sails-prod is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/).

sails-prod [controllers](http://sailsjs.org/documentation/concepts/controllers) are compatible with Connect middleware, so in most cases, you can paste code into Sails from an existing Express project and everything will work-- plus you'll be able to use WebSockets to talk to your API, and vice versa.

NO ORM i.e. [Waterline](https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline), --> we will remove completely this layer since we are not confident into this ORM layer, in stead of that we will create a db lib to allow to load your model and actual implementation for each database i.e. User.create -> then we will allow you to bind your create method with mongodb, mysql,...
